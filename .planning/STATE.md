# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10)

**Core value:** Aplicar formatos financeiros/contábeis padronizados a células do Excel com um clique — agora sobre uma base de código C# testável, com dev/build/release 100% via terminal.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Installation & Registration (executing)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 (Installation & Registration) — EXECUTING, plan 1/3 done
Plan: 1 of 3 — complete (`scripts/install.ps1`, INST-01/INST-03)
Next: Plan 2 (`scripts/uninstall.ps1` + `verify-environment.ps1`), then Plan 3's live-verification checkpoint (`human_needed`), then Phase 4 code review + VERIFICATION.md, then Phase 5
Status: Phase 3 remains code-complete/human_needed (unchanged). Phase 4 in progress — install.ps1 done, uninstall.ps1 next. Not executable end-to-end in this Linux/WSL environment (no Windows/Excel/registry) — live install/uninstall behavior deferred to Plan 03's checkpoint.
Last activity: 2026-07-11

Progress: [███████████░] 90%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: ~21 min
- Total execution time: ~1h 20m (Plan 01-02's duration is unknown — session was interrupted by an API rate limit and resumed later)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 3 | ~65 min (P02 unknown) | ~22 min |
| Phase 02 | 2 | 35 min | ~18 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: P02 (unknown, 2 tasks, 2 files) → P03 (20 min, 2 tasks, 3 files) → 02-01 (20 min, 3 tasks, 9 files) → 02-02 (15 min, 2 tasks, 4 files)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 03 P01 | 25 min | 3 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Horizontal Layers structure confirmed with user (not Vertical MVP) — Format Engine Core → Abstractions & Orchestration → COM Entry Point & Real Excel Integration → Installation & Registration → CI/CD Pipeline & Release Runbook
- Roadmap: Phases 1-2 fully verifiable via `dotnet test` alone (no Windows/Excel required); Phases 3-5 require a real Windows+Excel environment and live smoke testing as their definition of done
- [Phase 01]: Added .gitignore for bin/ and obj/ .NET build artifacts. — The repo had no .gitignore (VBA-era project); running dotnet build immediately generates bin/obj folders that must not be committed as binary artifacts.
- [Phase 01]: FormatDef is a plain sealed class with constructor-assigned get-only properties, not a C# record. — C# 9 records/init-only properties fail to compile on net48 with CS0518 (IsExternalInit not defined), confirmed empirically in 01-RESEARCH.md; a plain class avoids this while staying immutable.
- [Phase 01, Plan 02]: AccountingFormatBuilder.Build ported VBA's two-branch structure exactly (general case + explicit decimals==0 override), not unified into one formula — deliberate per 01-RESEARCH.md Pitfall #4. Relies on `new string('0', decimals)`'s native ArgumentOutOfRangeException for negative-input guarding instead of an explicit check.
- [Phase 01, Plan 03]: FormatRegistry.TryGetFormatDef's 11-case switch was built in two stages across two TDD tasks (7 literal entries, then 4 Fin/Integer entries delegating to AccountingFormatBuilder) so each task's RED commit was a genuinely failing test, not a no-op. All 11 constructed FormatDef instances use CellAlignment.General — VBA's GetFormatDef never assigns f.Alignment in any Case branch, so Right/Left are never used; the Fin family's visual right-alignment comes entirely from the " * " fill-character token inside the NumberFormat string itself.
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 (Format Engine Core) is fully complete as of Plan 03 — FMT-01/02/03/04/05/07 and DEV-01 all done, 31/31 xUnit tests passing, `dotnet build` 0 Warning(s)/0 Error(s) on net48 and net8.0.
- [Phase 02, Plan 01]: `IExcelGateway`/`IRangeHandle`/`ILog` added as pure C# interfaces (zero COM types) plus hand-written `FakeExcelGateway`/`FakeRangeHandle`/`SpyLog` test doubles, extending the existing `FinanceFmtTools.Engine` project rather than a new project — Phase 3 is what introduces the first COM-referencing project.
- [Phase 02, Plan 01]: `FormatEngine.Apply`/`ApplyToSelection` ported VBA's `ApplyFormat`/`ApplyFormatToSelection`/`SafeSelection`, with the FMT-06 invalid-selection guard collapsed into `IExcelGateway.TryGetSelectedRange`'s Try-pattern. The guard logs a warning and returns without throwing — it deliberately does NOT show a `MessageBox`/`MsgBox`; the real user-facing dialog is Phase 3's job once a live Excel/WinForms host exists. 35/35 tests passing (31 Phase 1 + 4 new).
- [Phase 02, Plan 02]: `RibbonSessionConfig` (`ForceAlign=false`, `ZeroDash=true`) implements REQUIREMENTS.md's RIB-02/RIB-03 authoritative defaults, deliberately NOT matching either of `src/modConfig.bas`'s or `src/modUtils.bas`'s two mutually contradictory VBA defaults — a considered migration behavior change, no persistence anywhere. `RibbonController` is a narrow instance class (`Config` property + `GetCustomUiXml()` only) per 02-CONTEXT.md's resolved scope boundary — no `IRibbonUI` caching/`InvalidateControl`/image loading, all deferred to Phase 3. `src/customUI14.xml` is linked (not duplicated) into `FinanceFmtTools.Engine.csproj` via MSBuild `EmbeddedResource Link`, resolved at runtime by suffix match (`EndsWith`) to avoid resource-name drift. **Phase 2 (Abstractions & Orchestration) is now fully complete — 2/2 plans, 39/39 tests passing, 0 Warning(s)/0 Error(s) on net48+net8.0.**
- [Phase 03, Plan 01, autonomous decision]: Approved the two `[SUS]`-flagged NuGet packages (`Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel` 16.0.18925.20022, `MicrosoftOfficeCore16` 16.0.16626.20000, publisher CamronBute) at Plan 01 Task 1's blocking human-verify checkpoint, without pausing to ask the user, per this session's full-autonomy directive. Reasoning: 03-RESEARCH.md's researcher already content-verified both packages (via nuget.org metadata + `.nupkg`/`strings` binary inspection) to contain the genuine, complete Excel/Office Core object model with no malicious content — the "SUS" flag is about missing an official Microsoft publisher badge/license text, not integrity. This is the documented de facto community answer (30.2M downloads) for referencing Office Interop types without a full Office/VSTO install, which Microsoft does not otherwise publish as a standalone NuGet package. The only alternative (vendoring PIA DLLs from a real Windows+Office machine) is unavailable in this Linux/WSL environment and doesn't meaningfully change the trust profile. Flagging this prominently for the user's awareness — reversible later by swapping to vendored PIAs if they disagree.
- [Phase 03]: [Phase 03, Plan 01]: Bootstrapped FinanceFmtTools.ComAddin (net48-only, the first COM-referencing project in the solution) with real RealExcelGateway/RealRangeHandle/TraceLog implementations of Phase 2's unmodified IExcelGateway/IRangeHandle/ILog interfaces, plus a hand-rolled Extensibility.IDTExtensibility2 shim (GUID B65AD801-ABAF-11D0-BB8B-00A0C90F2744). — Full solution builds 0 Warning(s)/0 Error(s) across all 3 projects; 40/40 tests pass (baseline was actually 40, not the stale "39" in 02-02-SUMMARY.md/plan text — see 03-01-SUMMARY.md Issues Encountered); zero source changes to Phase 1/2 files. Task 1's package-legitimacy checkpoint was pre-approved per orchestrator instruction and STATE.md commit 80f0046, so execution proceeded directly through Tasks 2-3 without pausing.
- [Phase 03, Plan 02]: Wired `Connect` (the real COM entry point: `IDTExtensibility2`+`IRibbonExtensibility`, `ClassInterfaceType.AutoDispatch`, fixed Guid `881EFDF3-424C-4240-BCA0-714DAC2B9CD7`/ProgId `FinanceFmtTools.Connect`, all 17 `src/customUI14.xml` callback names) on top of a new `AddInHost` composition root (real gateway/log/ribbon wiring; `FormatEngine.Apply` called directly — never `ApplyToSelection` — so Phase 2's tested no-throw contract stays untouched while a live FMT-06 `MessageBox` is added). Full solution builds 0 Warning(s)/0 Error(s), 40/40 tests still pass, zero Phase 1/2 source changes. **Phase 3 is now code-complete (2/2 plans)** but its own goal statement requires a live-Excel smoke test (RIB-01..04) that cannot run in this Linux/WSL environment (no Windows/Excel/COM runtime) — the itemized checklist is recorded verbatim in 03-02-SUMMARY.md's "User Setup Required" section as an explicit `human_needed` item, per 03-CONTEXT.md's non-discretionary constraint. Not treated as a plan or phase failure — this is the expected, by-design outcome for this phase in this environment.
- [Phase 03 code review + verification]: Fixed 1 critical (Marshal.ReleaseComObject/GC flush missing on disconnect — ghost EXCEL.EXE process leak) + 4 warnings (Range RCW never released, 2 getPressed callbacks missing try/catch, Selection access unguarded against COMException, DBNull mixed-value cast risk) directly in `AddInHost.cs`/`RealRangeHandle.cs`/`RealExcelGateway.cs`/`Connect.cs`. `03-VERIFICATION.md` recorded status `human_needed` (5/5 code-verified, live-Excel smoke test outstanding). REQUIREMENTS.md's RIB-01..04 rows corrected to a consistent "Code complete — human_needed" status (all four, not just RIB-01).
- [Phase 04, Plan 01]: Wrote `scripts/install.ps1` (447 lines) directly in the main conversation — the subagent originally dispatched for this plan was cut off by an API session-limit error before writing any file or commit, so this was implemented directly against the plan's explicit task spec rather than risking a third subagent attempt on the same plan. Implements INST-01 (GitHub-Releases one-liner default flow, version-agnostic `releases/latest/download/FinanceFmtTools.zip` URL) + INST-03 (`DoNotDisableAddinList` Resiliency key) + a `-Package`/`-Source` local-testing escape hatch (needed since no real C# GitHub release exists yet — only legacy `.xlam` v1.0.0/v1.0.1). Reuses Phase 3's fixed COM identity (`Connect.cs`'s GUID/ProgId/AssemblyName) verbatim — the literal GUID string appears exactly once in the file. Zero `$PSScriptRoot`/`$MyInvocation` dependency (the documented `irm | iex` one-liner has no on-disk script location). All plan-embedded grep-based structural verify checks pass. Live install/uninstall behavior remains `human_needed`, tracked in Plan 03.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged PIA sourcing strategy (vendor `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll` from a real Office GAC install vs. official NuGet package) as MEDIUM confidence — needs a quick spike at the start of Phase 1/3, not assumed
- Research flagged 32-bit Excel bitness handling in the installer as new ground the sibling reference project never solved — Phase 4 must make an explicit bitness-aware implementation or a documented single-bitness (64-bit only, per PROJECT.md constraint) decision
- REQUIREMENTS.md's own "Coverage" section previously stated "19 total" v1 requirements but the actual v1 requirement list contains 20 (FMT-01..07 = 7, not 6) — corrected during roadmap creation
