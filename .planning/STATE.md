# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10)

**Core value:** Aplicar formatos financeiros/contábeis padronizados a células do Excel com um clique — agora sobre uma base de código C# testável, com dev/build/release 100% via terminal.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Format Engine Core

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Horizontal Layers structure confirmed with user (not Vertical MVP) — Format Engine Core → Abstractions & Orchestration → COM Entry Point & Real Excel Integration → Installation & Registration → CI/CD Pipeline & Release Runbook
- Roadmap: Phases 1-2 fully verifiable via `dotnet test` alone (no Windows/Excel required); Phases 3-5 require a real Windows+Excel environment and live smoke testing as their definition of done
- [Phase 01]: Added .gitignore for bin/ and obj/ .NET build artifacts. — The repo had no .gitignore (VBA-era project); running dotnet build immediately generates bin/obj folders that must not be committed as binary artifacts.
- [Phase 01]: FormatDef is a plain sealed class with constructor-assigned get-only properties, not a C# record. — C# 9 records/init-only properties fail to compile on net48 with CS0518 (IsExternalInit not defined), confirmed empirically in 01-RESEARCH.md; a plain class avoids this while staying immutable.
- [Phase 01, Plan 02]: AccountingFormatBuilder.Build ported VBA's two-branch structure exactly (general case + explicit decimals==0 override), not unified into one formula — deliberate per 01-RESEARCH.md Pitfall #4. Relies on `new string('0', decimals)`'s native ArgumentOutOfRangeException for negative-input guarding instead of an explicit check.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged PIA sourcing strategy (vendor `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll` from a real Office GAC install vs. official NuGet package) as MEDIUM confidence — needs a quick spike at the start of Phase 1/3, not assumed
- Research flagged 32-bit Excel bitness handling in the installer as new ground the sibling reference project never solved — Phase 4 must make an explicit bitness-aware implementation or a documented single-bitness (64-bit only, per PROJECT.md constraint) decision
- REQUIREMENTS.md's own "Coverage" section previously stated "19 total" v1 requirements but the actual v1 requirement list contains 20 (FMT-01..07 = 7, not 6) — corrected during roadmap creation
